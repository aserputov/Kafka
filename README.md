# Kafka

This application demonstrates how to use Kafka to produce and consume messages, and how to use Node.js to display the consumed data in a visually appealing line chart. It showcases the versatility and functionality of these technologies in a simple and straightforward manner.

This application can be enhanced by implementing web sockets to enable real-time data visualization. The Kafka ecosystem, including Zookeeper and the Kafka server, is run locally using either binary or Docker. These technologies work together to provide a powerful and efficient means of producing and consuming messages.
